# Render.com Deployment Fixes

## 🚨 Issue Identified

Your Render.com deployment was failing due to a **React types version conflict**:

```
npm error ERESOLVE could not resolve
npm error While resolving: @types/react-dom@18.3.7
npm error Found: @types/react@19.1.8
npm error Could not resolve dependency:
npm error peer @types/react@"^18.0.0" from @types/react-dom@18.3.7
```

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed React Types Versions**
Updated `package.json` to use compatible versions:
```json
{
  "@types/react": "^18.3.0",
  "@types/react-dom": "^18.3.0"
}
```

### 2. **Added .npmrc Configuration**
Created `.npmrc` file to handle peer dependency conflicts:
```
legacy-peer-deps=true
fund=false
audit=false
package-lock=true
```

### 3. **Updated render.yaml Build Command**
Simplified and fixed the build process:
```yaml
buildCommand: npm install --legacy-peer-deps && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run setup:render && npm run build
```

### 4. **Created Render Setup Script**
Added `scripts/render-setup.ts` to handle post-deployment setup:
- Creates admin user
- Sets up default roles
- Configures system settings
- Handles errors gracefully (won't fail deployment)

### 5. **Updated Package Scripts**
Added new script for Render.com setup:
```json
{
  "setup:render": "npx tsx scripts/render-setup.ts"
}
```

## 🚀 Deployment Process Now

### **Build Command Flow:**
1. `npm install --legacy-peer-deps` - Install dependencies with conflict resolution
2. `npx prisma generate` - Generate Prisma client for PostgreSQL
3. `npx prisma migrate deploy` - Run database migrations
4. `npm run setup:render` - Create admin user and system settings
5. `npm run build` - Build Next.js application

### **What Gets Created:**
- ✅ PostgreSQL database with all tables
- ✅ Super admin user: `admin@mopgomglobal.com` / `SuperAdmin123!`
- ✅ Default roles (Super Admin, Admin, User)
- ✅ System settings and configuration
- ✅ Production-ready Next.js build

## 📧 Email Configuration

Your email settings are already configured in `render.yaml`:
- **SMTP Host**: smtp.gmail.com
- **SMTP User**: samuel.obadina93@gmail.com
- **SMTP Pass**: mlre wwdl wnvr vimd
- **From Name**: MopgomYouth
- **Admin Emails**: admin@youthreg.com, samuel.obadina93@gmail.com

## 🔄 Next Deployment Steps

### **Option 1: Push to GitHub (Recommended)**
1. Commit and push all changes to your GitHub repository
2. Render.com will automatically detect changes and redeploy
3. The new build process will handle all dependency conflicts

### **Option 2: Manual Redeploy**
1. Go to your Render.com dashboard
2. Find your service
3. Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

## 🎯 Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- ✅ App will be live at: `https://mopgomyouth.onrender.com`
- ✅ Admin login at: `https://mopgomyouth.onrender.com/admin/login`
- ✅ Health check at: `https://mopgomyouth.onrender.com/api/health`
- ✅ Email functionality will work with your Gmail SMTP
- ✅ Database will be fully set up with admin user

## 🔍 Monitoring Deployment

### **Check Build Logs:**
1. Go to Render.com dashboard
2. Click on your service
3. Go to "Logs" tab
4. Watch for these success messages:
   - `✅ Dependencies installed successfully`
   - `✅ Prisma client generated`
   - `✅ Database migrations deployed`
   - `✅ Super admin user created`
   - `✅ Default system settings created`
   - `🎉 Render.com setup completed successfully!`

### **Verify Deployment:**
1. Visit your app URL
2. Check health endpoint: `/api/health`
3. Login to admin panel
4. Test email functionality

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### **If Build Still Fails:**
1. Check the build logs for specific errors
2. Ensure all environment variables are set in Render dashboard
3. Verify GitHub repository has all the latest changes

### **If Admin Login Doesn't Work:**
1. Check the build logs for admin creation messages
2. Try the health endpoint to verify app is running
3. Check database connection in Render dashboard

### **If Email Doesn't Work:**
1. Verify Gmail app password is correct
2. Check SMTP settings in admin panel
3. Test with Settings → Email → Send Test Email
